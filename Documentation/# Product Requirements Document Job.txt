* **FR-4.7.4:** Data shall be loaded from `localStorage` upon application startup.

## 5. Design & UX Considerations
* **DUX-5.1:** Maintain a consistent dark theme throughout the application for visual comfort and reduced eye strain.
* **DUX-5.2:** Ensure clear visual hierarchy and separation between different sections and elements using borders, spacing, and background color variations.
* **DUX-5.3:** Use monospace fonts for text areas where users paste code-like or pre-formatted text (Job Description, Resume, Cover Letter, Feedback Output) to improve readability.
* **DUX-5.4:** The application shall be responsive and usable on common desktop screen sizes. Mobile responsiveness is a secondary concern for this iteration but should not be entirely broken.
* **DUX-5.5:** Interactive elements (buttons, draggable cards) shall provide clear visual feedback (hover states, dragging styles).
* **DUX-5.6:** Loading states for asynchronous operations (like LLM calls) should be clearly indicated to the user.
* **DUX-5.7 (Dashboard):** The Dashboard should present information in a quickly digestible format (e.g., stat cards, concise lists) to provide an actionable overview without overwhelming the user.

## 6. Technical Considerations (Current Implementation)
* **TC-6.1:** The application is a pure client-side solution built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and vanilla JavaScript.
* **TC-6.2:** Asynchronous operations (LLM API calls) are handled using the `fetch` API and Promises (`async/await`).
* **TC-6.3:** No external JavaScript frameworks (like React, Vue, Angular) are used in the current version.
* **TC-6.4:** Error handling for API calls is basic; more robust error handling is a future consideration.

## 7. Future Considerations / Roadmap Ideas
* **Backend & Database:** Transition to a server-side backend (e.g., Supabase) with a persistent database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to enable user accounts, data synchronization, and overcome `localStorage` limitations.
* **User Authentication:** Implement user registration and login.
* **Enhanced LLM Capabilities:**
    * Streaming LLM responses.
    * LLM-assisted generation of company research.
    * LLM-assisted drafting of cover letter sections.
* **Dashboard & Analytics:**
    * Develop the "Analytics" page.
    * Add more advanced metrics to the Dashboard (e.g., interview rate, offer rate, time in stage, application submission trends).
    * Add upcoming interview dates to the dashboard.
* **File Management:** Allow direct uploading and storage of resume/cover letter documents.
* **Advanced Search/Filtering:** More granular filtering options on the Kanban board (e.g., by date, by specific note content).
* **Notifications/Reminders:** For follow-up dates.

## 8. Open Questions / Assumptions
* **Assumption 1:** Users have access to and can configure a local Ollama instance if they choose that option.
* **Assumption 2:** Users can obtain and manage their own Google Gemini API key if they choose that option.
* **Assumption 3:** The primary value for this iteration is providing the core tracking, AI-tailoring, and dashboard overview functionality, even with client-side storage.
* **Question 1:** What is the ideal number of upcoming follow-ups to display on the dashboard? (Currently 5).
* **Question 2:** What are the most critical error scenarios for LLM interactions that need more robust handling in the immediate next steps?
